# Hi, I am Edgar Obuluk, a Data Analytics professional passionate about translating data into actionable insights! 

I am a results-oriented data analytics and information management professional with 7 years of experience in data analytics, health informatics, and monitoring and evaluation for large-scale development projects funded by USAID, PEPFAR, CDC, and UNICEF. I specialize in analyzing complex data to generate actionable insights that drive data-informed decision-making.

Proficient in Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, and Python visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, I also leverage tools such as Power BI to deliver accurate and impactful results. I have successfully led projects in health systems integration, data cleaning, and developing interactive dashboards. For example, I reduced data processing time by 30% by streamlining data cleaning procedures and improved health reporting accuracy by 20% through automated validation checks at selected health facilities in Uganda.

My expertise extends to designing and programming electronic data collection tools, conducting assessments and baselines, and implementing survey methodologies. I have a strong background in questionnaire design, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong ability to solve complex problems, optimize workflows, and improve outcomes using advanced analytical methods.

Passionate about using data to drive change, I am eager to apply my skills to new challenges in business analytics, information systems management, and project management.
